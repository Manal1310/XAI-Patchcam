The PatchCamelyon benchmark is a new and challenging image classification dataset. It consists of 327.680 color images (96 x 96px) extracted from histopathologic scans of lymph node sections. Each image is annoted with a binary label indicating presence of metastatic tissue.

Our goal in this project is to apply different explanation methods, in order to understand and interpret UNeT and ViT models classification of the PatchCamelyon Dataset.
